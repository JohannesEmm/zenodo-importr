## üìÅ File Structure

```
zenodo-bibtex-importer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.R                 # Main Shiny application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.bib       # Example BibTeX file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ authors.xlsx     # Example ORCID configuration
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Author ORCID Configuration (Optional)
Create an Excel file with the following columns:
- `Name`: Author name as it appears in your BibTeX
- `ORCID`: Corresponding ORCID identifier

Upload this file in the "Settings" tab to automatically add ORCID IDs to your publications.

## üîß Technical Details

### Supported Metadata Fields
The tool extracts and uploads the following metadata from BibTeX:
- Title
- Authors (with optional ORCID integration)
- Abstract/Description
- Publication date
- Journal information (title, volume, issue, pages)
- DOI
- Publication type
- Language (defaults to English)

### API Integration
- Uses Zenodo REST API v1
- Production Zenodo only (no sandbox support)
- Requires `deposit:write` permission scope
- Supports file uploads up to Zenodo's limits

### File Upload Process
1. Creates a new deposition on Zenodo
2. Uploads metadata in JSON format
3. Uploads PDF file to the deposition bucket
4. Optionally publishes the deposition

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access forbidden" error:**
- Check that your API token has `deposit:write` scope
- Ensure you're using a production Zenodo token (not sandbox)
- Verify the token is correctly entered in the application

**PDF not uploading:**
- Ensure PDF file exists and is accessible
- Check file size doesn't exceed Zenodo limits
- Verify PDF file format is valid

**BibTeX parsing errors:**
- Ensure BibTeX file is valid and properly formatted
- Check that the first entry contains required fields (title, author)
- Try with a simplified BibTeX entry for testing

### Debug Information
The application provides detailed console output for troubleshooting:
- File upload progress
- API response codes
- Metadata processing details
- Error messages with specific failure reasons
